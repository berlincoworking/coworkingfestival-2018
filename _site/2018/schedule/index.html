    Press Breakfast: Status Quo of Coworking in Berlin<br />
<br />
What about coworking in Berlin? What do you need to know about the Berlin coworking scene that is not in any WeWork, Mindspace & Co. press release? We have invited three extremely prominent and, above all, very experienced coworking experts as guests, who will be available to answer questions from the invited media. We are pleased that the following guests are taking part in the press breakfast:<br />
<br />
– Madeleine Gummer von Mohl, co-founder and CEO of betahaus<br />
– Ansgar Oberholz, co-founder and CEO of St. Oberholz<br />
– Carsten Foertsch, co-founder and CEO of deskmag<br />
<br />
The podium will be moderated by Johanna Voll, coworking researcher at Viadrina University and member of the board of the German Coworking Federation.<br />
<br />
As befits the St. Oberholz, of course not only people with a press card are invited, but all publishers of Berlin. :-)

    Out Of Berlin: Coworking in Brandenburg<br />
<br />
Coworking has long since ceased to be something reserved for urban space. In recent years, the idea of working together has also penetrated the countryside. We invited our neighbours to come to Rosenthaler Platz for an exchange and won some pioneers of coworking in Brandenburg. We are looking forward to the following guests:<br />
<br />
– Torsten Kohn from the "Old School" in Letschin<br />
– Antonia Polkehn from the "Blok-O" in Frankfurt (Oder)<br />
– Matthias Noack from the "MietWerk" in Potsdam<br />
– Janosch Dietrich from the "Coconat" in Bad Belzig<br />
<br />
The panel discussion will be moderated by Tobias Kremkau, coworking manager at St. Oberholz and author of the Netzpiloten column "Neue Provinz".<br />
<br />
We are looking forward to guests from near and far, especially of course from all corners of Brandenburg, but also from Berlin, who are interested in coworking.

    FREE COWORKING DAY<br />
<br />
Today we open the coworking area on the first floor of our house to the interested public, as they say in Germany. Coworking costs nothing that day and everyone can find out for themselves what it's like to work in a coworking space. Is there a better place than the café where everything started with coworking? We don't believe it and look forward to your visit.

    Panel discussion: Women in Coworking<br />
<br />
The coworking market is pushing into more and more niches, one of which is targetinf just over half the world's population. There are about 3.85 billion women in the world, but only a few coworking spaces exclusively for women and people who identify themselves as non-binary. At the same time, it seems that in recent years most coworking spaces in Germany have been founded by women, if you look at the minds behind the latest start-ups. We are therefore looking forward to talking to founders of Coworking Spaces in Berlin and Brandenburg. So far the following guests have agreed:<br />
<br />
– Katja Thiede, co-founder and CEO of the juggleHUB<br />
– Julianne Becker, co-founder and CEO of Coconat<br />
– further speakers are requested<br />
<br />
The panel discussion will be moderated by Katy Zühlke, head of project management at St. Oberholz and member of the board of the German Coworking Federation.<br />
<br />
We are looking forward to guests with X- and Y-chromosomes who are interested in coworking. The event will be held mainly in English.

    Future Of Work: The Modern-Day Freelancer<br />
<br />
Freelancing isn't a fad, it's here to stay - but while you support yourself, who's supporting you?<br />
<br />
In conjunction with the Berlin Coworking Festival, CodeControl & Vantik are taking this unique opportunity to explain just how they have created a much-needed support system for freelancers all over the world.<br />
<br />
CodeControl is a vetted community of 400 freelance developers, designers, and product managers. It's a one-stop shop for finding awesome gigs, growing your network, always getting paid on time, and so much more.<br />
<br />
Vantik is a retirement account for the independent. It's the first private pension fund that is tailored entirely to your needs - with all the transparency and flexibility you'd expect to have.<br />
<br />
The event will be moderated by Miryana from Ahoy Berlin and the speakers from CodeControl & Vantik will be Tristan and Lara, respectively.<br />
<br />
Big thank you to Ahoy Berlin for hosting!<br />

You want to know more about how others found the courage to make a change? You’re no longer happy in your job but are afraid to leave without having found a new job? Let’s talk about it and support each other in the process of growing, of doing and of developing a clearer path for ourselves!

    Friday Afternoon Coffee: Rural Coworking<br />
<br />
The most intensively discussed topic in the coworking scene at the moment is development in rural areas. More and more coworking spaces are being founded in small towns and villages, far away from Rosenthaler Platz and the logic of land use that real estate companies such as WeWork, Mindspace & Co. that only use the term coworking need in order to exist. In the countryside there is still the luxury of emptiness and people's need for spaces like coworking spaces is driven by values instead of profit. We are therefore looking for an exchange on this topic with people who deal with rural development and are looking forward to the following guests:<br />
<br />
- Mareike Meyn, Researcher at Andreas Hermes Academy<br />
- Silvia Hennig, Founder & CEO of Neuland 21<br />
- Philipp Hentschel, Founder & CEO of welance<br />
<br />
The panel discussion will be moderated by Tobias Kremkau, coworking manager at St. Oberholz and author of the Netzpiloten column "New Province".
